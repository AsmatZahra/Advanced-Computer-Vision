# To make patches for segmentation task

  * Attached file MonuSeg_patches.ipynb is used to make patches of large images available for segmentation dataset.
  * Monuseg [dataset](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/Data/) contains images of size 1000 however UNet requires small size so           patches are obtained of size 256 
  * Total Number of Large size images are : 30
  * Total Number of patches obtained are :1920 with overlap step of 100 (about 25%)
